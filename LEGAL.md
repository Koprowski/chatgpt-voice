# Legal and terms

## ChatGPT account requirement

**You must be signed into a paid ChatGPT account** (e.g. ChatGPT Plus) for this app to work. Voice dictation in the ChatGPT web interface is available to paid subscribers. This project is not affiliated with OpenAI; we do not guarantee availability of the feature for any account type.

Requiring a paid account also benefits OpenAI: it may encourage new signups or retain subscribers who value system-wide dictation powered by ChatGPT’s transcription.

## OpenAI Terms of Use

This app **automates** the ChatGPT web interface: it uses a browser (Playwright) to open ChatGPT, trigger the built-in voice input, and **programmatically read the transcribed text** from the page so it can be pasted into other applications.

OpenAI’s [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/row-terms-of-use) state that you may not *“automatically or programmatically extract data or Output”* from their Services. Using this app could therefore be considered a violation of those terms. Enforcement is up to OpenAI; they may take action (e.g. warning or restricting an account) if they treat this use as non-compliant.

**You use this software at your own risk.** By using it, you are responsible for your own compliance with OpenAI’s terms and applicable law. The authors of this project do not encourage or endorse violating any terms of service.

If you prefer to stay clearly within OpenAI’s terms, use an official interface (e.g. ChatGPT in the browser without automation, or an official API/product if OpenAI offers one for voice or transcription).
