# Where chatgpt-voice lived (before moving to its own repo)

## What was committed

- This project originally lived as a **subfolder** inside a larger monorepo.
- The published source was: **parent repo → `chatgpt-voice/`** (the full contents of this directory).

## After moving to its own repo

- **This repo** is the standalone `chatgpt-voice` project.
- You can clone it to any directory (e.g. `~/chatgpt-voice`, `C:\Tools\chatgpt-voice`, or elsewhere) and use that as the single source of truth.
- The parent repo no longer contains a `chatgpt-voice/` folder.
